extendint.h is for C/C++ users, compiler ver c99 and above is required, please follow the instructions in the file  
  
extendint++.h is for C++ users only, with most operators reconstructed, ~t represents 0-t, a^b represents pow(a,b), other operators are the same as normal datatypes  
  
the two files above are experimental high accuracy calculation functions for integers, may still have some unexpeceted bugs or something  
  
note:1.fft or ntt are NOT used in this algorithm, which means it might take huge amount of time calculationg big numbers, this might be optimized some day when I actually learn them  
2.due to my ignorance, bit opertations can yet be realized, this might NOT get optimized since i dont know how
